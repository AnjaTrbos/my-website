          <h2>Andrea Arntzen</h2>
          <p> <!-- Main content paragraph -->
            Andrea Arntzen was a pioneering woman in nursing and nursing education in Norway.
            She attended a course in nursing at Rikshospitalet in the early 1890s.
            At the time, there were few nursing schools in Norway, and many young women had to travel abroad to receive nursing education.
            She traveled to Hamburg in 1894 and took her education there.
            Later, she undertook several study trips abroad.
            In the spring of 1902, she stayed in England and Scotland, which were considered important pioneer countries because of Florence Nightingale's pioneering work,
            and in 1929 she traveled on a three-month study trip to Canada and the United States.
            In addition to these two extensive study trips, she made a number of shorter visits to major European hospitals.
